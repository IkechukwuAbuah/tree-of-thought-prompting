abstract: >-
  Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting, a fresh technique
  borrowing ideas from the Tree-of-Thoughts framework,
  broadens and enhances the well-established
  Chain-of-Thought prompting concept, thereby enabling Large
  Language Models, like ChatGPT, to exhibit superior
  reasoning abilities. This Tree-of-Thought Prompting
  technique permits Large Language Models to rectify their
  errors autonomously while progressively accumulating
  knowledge.
